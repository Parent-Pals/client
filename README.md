# What are we solving?
* We learned that parents often can't get their children to do chores around the house, so we set out to fix that.

# How are we solving it?
* Little Helpers is a task-reward tracking app usable by both parents and their children, so that the kids can see what they're working for and what they need to do to achieve it. The parents, meanwhile, can add and remove tasks and rewards as necessary.

* Add improved functionality
